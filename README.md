# onsocio

Onsocio is a website that helps you find any twitter user's interest in fields such as sports, entertainment, technology, politics, quotes(others) and environment based on the tweets and the followings of that person. Also sentiment analysis is done so as to know more about the nature of that person.

I thought this would help recruiters especially HRs while hiring employees.

You will be required to install the dependencies before you can use the project.

Dependencies :
1.Flask
2.numpy
3.pandas
4.scikit-learn
5.scipy

The jupyter notebooks provides you a way to create the required pickle files that will be used by the project.
Place the pickle files into the project directory.

I made this project using pycharm so it is necessary to add venv in the project folder which i haven't uploaded.

The datasets and python scripts used to create them are in data directory.
I have provided datasets for fields i.e., sports, entertainment, technology, politics, quotes(others) and environment only.
The dataset used for sentiment analysis is Stanford twitter sentiment file which is available on various sites. Also put them in data folder and give appropriate names as given in jupyter notebook 'sklearn polarity.ipynb'.

Any suggestions and improvements are welcome.
