You will be required to install the dependencies before you can use the project.

Dependencies :
1.Flask
2.numpy
3.pandas
4.scikit-learn
5.scipy

The jupyter notebooks provide you a way to create the required pickle files that will be used by the project.
Place the pickle files into the project directory.

I made this project using pycharm so it is necessary to add venv in the project folder which i haven't uploaded.
